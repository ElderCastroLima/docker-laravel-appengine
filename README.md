# Laravel dockerized with official Google App Engine flexible php environment + swoole
Laravel dockerized with: gcr.io/google-appengine/php72 + swoole, postgres:10.4-alpine, redis:4.0.11-alpine and others (ready for production).

You can build this image for production on GAE flexible using auto managed redis and database by Google Cloud Plataform building from the Dockerfile, or run all locally using the docker-compose file.

## How to use locally

- You need to have docker installed.
- Put docker-compose.yml file on the root of your laravel project.
- Run ```docker-compose up -d```
- Run ```docker-compose run app composer update```
- Thats all folks :) Now you have locally exactly the same image that you run on GAE flexible php environment.
- Of course, remember to bind your .env variables and hosts with your docker-compose.yml file.

## How to use in Google App Engine (GAE)

Just put the files on the root of your laravel project, then change your [app.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/php/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml) section: `runtime: php` to `runtime: custom`. Thats it ðŸŽ‰. You can learn more about GAE here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/

## Tips to customization

You can edit `php.ini`, `php-cli.ini`, `nginx.conf`, `nginx-http.conf`, `nginx-app.conf` and `php-fpm-user.conf` files, just add them to the root folder and make your changes, they will be enabled on the next `docker-compose up --build`

The `suppervisord.conf` file is ready to run the swoole server and horizon at the start, and the `php artisan schedule:run` command each minute.

## Swoole

I did some edits in Dockerfile, extending the official image (gcr.io/google-appengine/php72:latest) to enable swoole extension to get better performance. If you want use it, you can install this package: https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole. If you don't wanna to use swoole extension, then remove it from php.ini and Dockerfile or call the gcr.io/google-appengine/php72:latest directly from the docker-compose.yml file.
